## What is difference between React Context API and Redux?

```
React CONTEXT API

React Context API is a part of the React library that allows you to pass data down the component tree 
without explicitly passing the props through every level. It provides a way to share data between components,
 even if they are not directly related or nested in each other.

ADVANTAGES OF REACT CONTEXT API :
